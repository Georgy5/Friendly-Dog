## Background
This app was built during the coding bootcamp of Le Wagon (Batch 480) as a sort of simple Airbnb Clone, i.e. a Marketplace app.
Our fictional market is for specialy trained dogs, such as a guide dog / seeing eye dog or just a dog for emotional support.

## Team
The wonderful team that made this consists of [Lena](https://github.com/LG-2), [Mark](https://github.com/markMounsey), [Peter](https://github.com/huyserp) and myself.


## Extra info
Rails app generated with [lewagon/rails-templates](https://github.com/lewagon/rails-templates), created by the [Le Wagon coding bootcamp](https://www.lewagon.com) team.
